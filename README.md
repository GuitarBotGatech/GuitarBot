### Future Improvements
## UI
- Scrollbar
- Drag & drop for song components
- "Legend" for how to input chords
- Saving custom strum pattern
- Strum patterns for different time signatures (how to handle a user trying to put a 3/4 strum pattern into a 4/4 bar?)
- 6/8? Custom time signatures?

Existing bugs:
- Section "Name" input box does not show up in 2/4 with only one bar
- Tab issue: details are documented in UIGen.py at the beginning of the "Section" class
